## Zildith Network Rotations

This repository contains a listing of files which correspond to all public Zildith Network rotations.

### Contributing

You can suggest changes to the rotations by opening an [issue](https://github.com/ZildithNetwork/Rotations/issues) in this repository. Please make sure your request follows these guidelines:

- A request should add or remove a **single map** to/from the rotations. Multiple changes require multiple issues.
- Maps to be added must already be in the map repository.
- Make sure your request doesn't duplicate an [existing request](https://github.com/ZildithNetwork/Rotations/issues).
- If you want to re-submit a rejected map because it has been significantly improved, re-open the [existing issue](https://github.com/ZildithNetwork/Rotations/issues), rather than creating a new one.
- The title of your issue should contain the type of change and the map name e.g. "Add Clay Wars"

While we welcome community input, please understand that final decisions are made by the Zildith Network map developers.
